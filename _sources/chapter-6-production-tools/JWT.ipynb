    "\n",
    "In the API world, authentification is a process where we want to authenticate a user. In real world applications, only authenticated users can access the API. Additionaly, we may want to track how much does a specific user query an API. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2) The server checks the credentials and if they are correct, it generates a JWT token. The token gets sent back to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Every time the user makes a request to any of the APIs on a certain server, it has to include the JWT token. Only the JWT token is used to authenticate the user.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the JWT flow, we still cannot escape the good old username and password combination. We need to store this information somewhere in the server and every time a user requests a new token, we need to check if the user credentials are correct. For this, we need to create an endpoint for user registration and then for token generation. Because of this reason, the whole process of authentification ideally should be done via HTTPS and not HTTP. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use HTTP, because the concepts are exactly the same. HTTPS only adds a layer of obfuscation and encodes the transactions between user and server. \n",
