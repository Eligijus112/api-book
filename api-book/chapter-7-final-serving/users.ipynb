    "Just as in the previous chapter, we will create an endpoint that registers a user. This time, we will add a layer of security: we will hash the password before storing it in the database. This is done because we don't want to store plain text passwords in the database in case someone gets access to the database. To decrypt the password one needs to know the `secret key` which is only known to the server.  "
