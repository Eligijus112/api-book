    "Since it's launch in March 20, 2013, docker has reshaped alot of companies' ideas about development and production. Docker enabled developers to isolate and have reproducable application results across **any** environment where the application is or would be running, given, that an environment has docker engine installed. A developer can simulate any production environment on his/hers computer. This environment isolation and seamless transition between development and production saves alot of time and headaches.    \n",

    "## What is docker?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is an **ecosystem of managing containers**. The definition splits into terms with definitions of their own:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **docker ecosystem** is a collection of *docker backend engine*, *docker image registry* and any other helper software for container and image managment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* A **docker container** is a runtime instance of a docker image. An informal definition of a container is that it is an isolated application with all the needed dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Runtime** is a phase of a program when the instructions (code) are beeing actively run on a CPU. While the program is running (is in *runtime*), it is assigned a PID.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* An **instance** is an object that is created using a template (in docker universe - an image).\n",
    "\n",
    "* A docker **image** is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **docker backend engine** is the main program that creates images, containers and manages every other process that is docker related. Nothing will run if docker backend is not installed on a system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* A **docker image registry** is an application that enables the storing, updating and downloading of docker images. The most popular image registry is **https://hub.docker.com/**. This book's image can be publicly accesed via https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/eligijusbujokas/ml-serving-book\n",

    "At the bottom of the graph there is OS hardware components: RAM, CPU and space to store files, among other things. Docker interacts with the resources of the computer via the OS kernel. Therefore, there may be some glitches and bugs when working on docker in Linux vs on Windows, altough **most** of the time, the containers on both OS work the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every docker image has it's own space in the filesystem. \n",

    "Every running docker container has an isolated RAM, CPU, disk space and GPU resources that only it can reach. "
