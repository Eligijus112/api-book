    "# Migrations \n",
    "\n",
    "A `schema migration` (or populary termed just `migration`) is a process of changing the database schema in a trackable and reversible way. To put it simpler, every time we make a change to a table or tables in a database, we make a `migration`. Under the hood, each migration is just an SQL script that is run against the database. What is very important, howerer, is that every migration needs to know what has happened before it. If we lose history of migrations, we will run into huge productions problems and will probably need to start from scratch.  \n",

    "# Migrations in Python - Alembic\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a very simple yet powerfull framework for managing database migrations - `Alembic`. As the authors put it: \n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Alembic is a lightweight database migration tool for usage with the SQLAlchemy Database Toolkit for Python\"*. One can read on the [Alembic website](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize the root folder for alembic, type the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "alembic init alembic-migrations\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a folder `alembic-migrations` in the current directory along with a `alembic.ini` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "├── alembic.ini\n",
    "├── alembic-migrations/\n",
    "│   ├── env.py\n",
    "│   ├── README\n",
    "│   ├── script.py.mako\n",
    "│   └── versions/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `alembic.ini` file contains the configuration for the database connection and general alembic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `env.py` file holds the environmental variables for the database connection and where the objects from other Python scripts get impoerted.\n",
    " \n",
    "The `script.py.mako` file is the template for the migration scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `versions` folder is where the migration scripts are stored.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Alembic in action \n",
    "\n",
    "## alembic.ini file \n",
    "\n",
    "The alembic.ini file holds the URI to connect to a database in question. It is a best practise to use on alembic.ini file per database. By default it is populated with some variables. The most important one is `sqlalchemy.url` one. By default, the value is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sqlalchemy.url = driver://user:pass@localhost/dbname\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://user:password@localhost:5429/postgres\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now every time we run a command `alembic ...` it will try to connect via the URL we specified and make changes there. \n",
    "\n",
    "## models.py file \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a user created file holding all the database models (tables). We define the tables with the already seen SQLAlchemy declarative base class."
