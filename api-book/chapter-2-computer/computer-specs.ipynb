The important thing to know is that a transistor is made on a substrate, or slab, of some semiconducting material, usually silicon.

They’re made through a process called photolithography, which involves projecting a picture of a transistor onto a silicon wafer and developing it. This process is suitable for mass production because large numbers of transistors can be projected onto a single silicon wafer substrate, developed, and then sliced up into individual components.\"**{cite}`secret_life_computers`\n",

Disk drives, also known as mass storage, are great for storing immense amounts of data. \\<...>\\. They’re often referred to as mass storage.

If you want something that just passed by the head, you have to wait almost an entire rotation for it to come around again. Modern disks spin at 7,200 rotations per minute (RPM), which means a rotation takes slightly longer than 8 milliseconds. The big problem with disk drives is that they’re mechanical and wear out. Bearing wear is one of the big causes of disk failure The difference between commercial and consumer-grade devices is primarily the amount of grease in the bearing—manufacturers are able to charge hundreds of dollars for something that costs less than a penny Disk drives store data by magnetizing areas on the disk, which makes them nonvolatile just like core memory. Disk drives are a trade-off between speed and density. They’re slow because of the time it takes for the bits you want to show up under the head, but because the data is being brought to the head, no space is required for address and data connections, unlike, for example, in a DRAM. They’re built in sealed containers because dust and dirt would cause them to fail.\"**{cite}`secret_life_computers`"

Disk drives are slowly being replaced by solid-state disk drives, which are pretty much just flash memory packaged up to look like a disk drive. Right now their price per bit is much higher than spinning disks, but that’s expected to change.
