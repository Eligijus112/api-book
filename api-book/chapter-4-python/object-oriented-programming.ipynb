    "In computing, a namespace is a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. The names are saved as pointers somewhere in computer memory. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified. To put it simply, *a namespace is a mapping from names to objects*.\n",

    "A class in Python is defined with the keyword `class` following with the class name. Each class has a constructor, which is a method that is called when an object of the class is created. The constructor is called automatically when an object is created. The constructor is defined with an internal function __init__().\n",
