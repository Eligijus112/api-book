    "# API server\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past chapter, we have created a simple API that can be called from a browser with one endpoint. That one endpoint returned the root of a number.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we call that endpoint (http://127.0.0.1:8000/root_of_number?number=2), all the transfering of data, waiting for Python calculations, and returning the result, is done by a program called `uvicorn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the writers of `uvicorn` say:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"`Uvicorn` is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, using **uvloop** and **httptools**\". \n",
    "\n",
    "To read the official documentation of the framework visit: https://www.uvicorn.org/ \n",
    "\n",
    "Programs like `uvicorn`, `gunicorn` and `gevent` are populary termed as API servers (they serve the API requests and response). When initiated, the program `uvicorn` creates an application in runtime (losely speaking, this program is called a server) and it is ready to accept connections. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reading the definitions and the documentations for the first time, it may not be easy to understand what is an API or what is an ASGI. Before diving deeper and writing more complex programs, it is important to understand the basics of the API server side. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Terminologies of API serving \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I provide a brief explanation of the terms used in the API serving.\n",
    "\n",
    "## API server\n",
    "\n",
    "The term `server` is used to describe the server side of an API. The server is the program that is running on the computer that is serving the API requests. `Uvicorn` is an API server that is in runtime on the machine it is started in, receives requests, runs the data from the requests through the user written code and returns the response. Every API server has its own PID on the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "## SYNC vs ASYNC\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronous (sync) API server is a type of server that sends out a request, waits for all the internal calculations to be completed, and returns the response. The underlying enpoint cannot be accessed while the initial calculations are being made. \n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous (async) API server is a type of server that sends out a request, and returns a response immediately. The underlying endpoint can be accessed while the initial calculations are being made. All the calls get queued and the server will process them in the order they were received.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Socket \n",
    "\n",
    "A socket is an electrical device that is used to connect a device to the source of electricity. \n",
    "\n",
    "![socket-mechanical](media/socket.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main subjects in a socket system: the socket itself and the device which is connecting to it. Keep this in mind when you are reading this section, it will make the grasping of linux sockets easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "A socket in Linux is a program (which has as PID) that enables the connection of two applications via a netork. In an API world, a socket on the server receives data and sends out a response, and a socket on the client receives the response and sends out a request.\n",
    "\n",
    "A diagram on sockets {cite}`sockets`: \n",
    "\n",
    "![socket](media/TCPsockets.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is a protocol that is used to send data over a network. As we can see from the graph, a socket is created on the server side which has different functionalities than the user side. We can view a socket as an actively running object in computer memory with standart methods: \n",
    "\n",
    "* connect()\n",
    "* send()\n",
    "* recv()\n",
    "* close()\n",
    "* bind()\n",
    "* listen()\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets assume we are running the API server via the link http://127.0.0.1:8000. The `uvicorn` application automaticaly creates a socket between the **IP** address of 127.0.0.1 (which is the local machine), port 8000 with any calls to the link. The `uvicorn` framework automatically creates a socket for every request that is received. \n",
    "\n",
    "## ASGI\n",
    "\n",
    "**ASGI** stands for Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface. It is a specification for the API server side, containing a set of rules that defines how the API server should behave. In this case, the API server is asynchronously accepting requests, running them through the user written code and returning the response. \n",

    "\n",
    "The API server has a PID of `78406` and is listening on the port 8000 on the localhost machine. When a client sends data to the address http://127.0.0.1:8000, the request is \"hijacked\" by uvicorn and all the logic starts. The first thing that uvicorn does is it checks whether an API endpoint exists which matches the request. If it does, it will run the code in the file `get_n_root.py` and return the response. If it does not, a response with status code 404 (resource not found) is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the client sends a request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/root?number=1879&root=0.75, a dictionary with the following content is returned:\n",

    "```\n",
    "{\"root\": 285.39416206496446}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is the answer to the problem of what is $1879^{0.75}$. The uvicorn server tracks all the traffic going into it and the above request creates a log entry of:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INFO: 127.0.0.1:57894 - \"GET /root?number=1879&n=0.75 HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the HTTP method of the request when we enter a link to a browser is **GET**. The server responded with the status code 200 which means OK. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we try another link like http://127.0.0.1:8000/groot?number=1879&root=0.75, we would get the following response:\n",
