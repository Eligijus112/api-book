    "# Databases and APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Alot of modern application can be modeled in the follwowing way: \n",
    "\n",
    "![modern-apps](media/modern-apps.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user opens an application frontend, either on a desktop or a mobile device, the code on the frontend starts calling the backed via APIs for various data. The backend then queries the database for all the necessary data, does all the computations with it, and sends the data back to the frontend for a nice visualization. One of the modern choices of an application backend is Python and Python has alot of functionalities for connecting and querying databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way how does backend interact with frontend and backend is through APIs. Often, the whole API server is just refered to as backend. The backend ussualy does hundreds and thousands calls to the database. But what is a database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A `database` is a collection of data organized in a structured way. The data is, in most cases, stored electronicaly on a computer. The way that data is stored on a database is managed by a `database management system` (DBMS). This means that 'running a database' refers to a process which is responsible for storing and retrieving data from a database. As the the database grows in data, so does the size of the database files on computer. To have a good intuitive understanding of a database, think of it as an extension and generalization of a spreadsheet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Databases and spreadsheets (such as Microsoft Excel) are both convenient ways to store information. The primary differences between the two are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How the data is stored and manipulated.\n",
    "* Who can access the data.\n",
    "* How much data can be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spreadsheets were originally designed for one user, and their characteristics reflect that. They’re great for a single user or small number of users who don’t need to do a lot of incredibly complicated data manipulation. Databases, on the other hand, are designed to hold much larger collections of organized information—massive amounts. Databases allow multiple users at the same time to quickly and  securely access and query the data using highly complex logic and language.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main advantages of databases is that they can be queried and updated. A database query is a request for data from a given database. The standart way to quety data is to use the `Structured Query Language` or `SQL` for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Database managment systems (DBMS)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several very popular DBMS in the industry today. The most popular ones are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* MySQL\n",
    "* PostgreSQL\n",
    "* MongoDB\n",
    "* SQLite\n",
    "* Oracle\n",
    "* Microsoft SQL Server \n",
    "\n",
    "Every DBMS has its own set of features and a slight variation of the SQL language. In this book, we will be using the open-sourced PostgreSQL DBMS https://www.postgresql.org/about/. \n",
    "\n",
    "# PSQL docker image \n",
    "\n",
    "We will run the PostgreSQL (PSQL for short) database from a docker container. By using docker, we will skip all the headaches of installing various dependencies and setting up the environment. We will just use the official docker image of psql: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres. \n",

    "# Using SQLAlchemy \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular libraries to connect and use databases with Python is SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy is a Python library that provides a high-level abstraction layer on top of many popular databases. To connect to most of the databases, we need to know its `URI`: Uniform Resource Identifier. The URI is a string that contains all the information needed to connect to the database. The URI has the following form: \n",
