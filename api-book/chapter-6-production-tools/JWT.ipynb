    "# JWT based authentification \n",
    "\n",
    "In the API world, authentification is a process where we want to authenticate a user. In real world applications, only authenticated users can access the API. Additionaly, we may want to track how much does a specific user query an API. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the complex issue of authentification, the current golden standart are the `JWT tokens`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`JWT` stands for JSON Web Token. \n",

    "The high level graph of the process: \n",

    "1) The user requests a token, sending over his credentials (username and password). \n",
    "\n",
    "2) The server checks the credentials and if they are correct, it generates a JWT token. The token gets sent back to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Every time the user makes a request to any of the APIs on a certain server, it has to include the JWT token. Only the JWT token is used to authenticate the user.\n",

    "# JWT token \n",
    "\n",
    "A JWT token is just a string that has three parts separated by dots:\n",
    "\n",
    "<header>.<payload>.<signature> \n",
    "\n",
    "An example may look like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Thats it, the above string is a JWT token that has alot of information encoded into it. There are many libraries that can be used both to create and to decode a JWT token. In the subsequent chapters we will use Python implementations of JWT authentification and go through the details of the JWT token system. \n",

    "# The authentification flow \n",
    "\n",
    "All the code is in the `jwt-toke-example` directory. Be sure to run \n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Requesting a token \n",
    "\n",
    "In the JWT flow, we still cannot escape the good old username and password combination. We need to store this information somewhere in the server and every time a user requests a new token, we need to check if the user credentials are correct. For this, we need to create an endpoint for user registration and then for token generation. Because of this reason, the whole process of authentification ideally should be done via HTTPS and not HTTP. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use HTTP, because the concepts are exactly the same. HTTPS only adds a layer of obfuscation and encodes the transactions between user and server. \n",

    "The user database table is very straightforward. It contains the username, the password and the date it was created: "
